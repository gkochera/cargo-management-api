# Cargo Management API

![Landing Page](./documentation/assets/landing-page.png)

This is was my Final Portfolio Project for Oregon State University's CS493 - Cloud Application Development course. It's a RESTful API that was built using Node.js and deployed to Google Cloud Platform. I keep it up and running since it is a great representation of my work in this class and my experience building RESTful APIs.

# Documentation

You can find the original PDF ![here](./documentation/cargo-management-api-documentation.pdf) that covers the data model for this project, the access levels for each endpoint as well as a comprehensive overview of accessing each endpoint.
